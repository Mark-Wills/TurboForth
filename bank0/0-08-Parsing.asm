;[ NUMBER ( address length -- number flag )
; Attempts to convert the string at address into a number. If fully successful,
; the number is placed on the stack and flag will be 0. If it fails (for example
; contains an illegal character) then a partial number will be placed on the 
; stack (the value computed up until the failure) and flag will be >0.
; Thus, if flag>0 the string failed to parse fully as a number.
; A minus sign is permitted for negative numbers.
; This routine uses BASE to parse numbers in the current BASE. 
; Eg. If BASE=16 then digits 0-9 and A-F are considered legal and will be 
; parsed properly.
; A facility also exists called 'quick hex' that allows a number to be entered
; in base 16, by placing a $ symbol at the end of the string. This avoids the
; need to change BASE to enter a number. E.g. instead of HEX FEED DECIMAL you
; can simply do $FEED. The number will be parsed as a HEX number without the
; need to change BASE.
; The numbers returned are (by default) singles (16 bits). NUMBER can can also
; return a double (32-bit (2 stack cells)) value by including a period in the
; number string. E.g. 100. 1.00 10.0 .100 will all return 100 decimal as a 
; double.
; The various facilities can be mixed. For example, f. means -15 as a double.
; - $ and . can be specified in any order. However, $ if required, should be
; specified before any number digits. - and . can come anywhere in the string.
