; File IO implementation                                       

; FILE ( s_addr  s_len  buf_addr -- )
; Builds a PAB in the buffer whose address is passed as buf_addr using the data
; in the string represented by s_addr and s_len.
; For example:
;     FBUF: PRINTER
;     S" PIO.CR DV80O" PRINTER FILE
; The above builds a PAB in the buffer called PRINTER which references the PIO
; device. Subsequent file IO words that wish to send data to the PIO shall use
; the buffer name to reference it:
; e.g. 
;     PRINTER #OPEN DROP ( open PIO and drop success/fail flag)
;     S" HELLO WORLD" PRINTER #PUT DROP 
;     ( write HELLO WORLD to the PIO and drop success/fail flag)
;
; Internally, FILE builds a PAB in the buffer which will be used by #OPEN and 
; all file IO words. 
; Word 0 of the reserved memory is used to point to the actual PAB in VDP 
; memory. 
; Enough space should be reserved (with ALLOT) in the buffer to hold the PAB 
; and the filename.
;
; The string which specifies the file name and file characteristics is defined 
; as below. 
; The filename *must* come first followed by a space character. 
; After that, the file options can be specified in any order.
;
; File Options:
;  F=Fixed    - Fixed record type
;  V=Variable    - Variable record type
;
;  D=Display    - Display data type
;  L=InternaL    - Internal data type
;
;  U=Update    - Update file mode
;  O=Output    - Output file mode
;  I=Input    - Inoput file mode
;  A=Append    - Append file mode
;
;  S=Sequential - Sequential file type
;  R=Relative    - Relative file type
;
; Note that Internal type files require L - this is because I is used to 
; specify INPUT

; FBUF: ( -- )
; builds a buffer with the name given for use with File IO. 
; The buffer is used to hold the PAB during construction by FILE.
; e.g. FBUF: MYFILE
; creates a 42 byte buffer for holding a PAB.
; MYFILE becomes a word in the dictionary which, when executed, returns the 
; address of the start of the buffer.
; The buffer is supplied as an input to the file IO words. E.g.
;   FBUF: DV80 ( create a 42 byte buffer called DV80)
;   S" DSK1.TEST DV80SO" DV80 FILE  
;   DV80 #OPEN DROP
;   S" HELLO WORLD" DV80 #PUT DROP
;   DV80 #CLOSE 
;

        data create         ; create dictionary entry
        data lit,42,allot   ; reserve 42 bytes
        data exit


; #OPEN ( buf_addr -- t|f )
; Opens a file with the file name and attributes specified in the buffer
; starting at file_addr.
; The buffer (actually a PAB) is set-up with FILE.
; E.g. FBUF: SERIAL
;      S" RS232.BA=9600 DV80SO" SERIAL FILE
;      SERIAL #OPEN
; The above shall attempt to open the serial port for output as a Display 
; Variable 80 type file. 
;
; #OPEN leaves a FALSE on the stack if the file was opened sucessfully. 
; If the file could not be opened then it leaves a TRUE on the stack. 
; This allows easy trapping with ABORT" as shown below:
;   SERIAL #OPEN ABORT" Could not open serial port"
;
; In the event of a file error, IOERR can be read to get the DSR error code. 
; If IOERR returns -1 (>FFFF) then this means that no free file IO slots were 
; found. A maximum of 3 open files is supported (2 if block files are also to 
; be used).
; Note that block files are immediately closed after they are accessed for 
; either reading or writing, so 3 generic file io streams are available
; when no blocks files are being used.

; #GET ( buff_addr fid -- t|f )
; reads a line of input from the file specified by fid.
; The address of an appropriately sized buffer must be supplied. 
; If the read is successful, the buffer is filled with the data read from the
; input device, with the first byte being the length count of the data 
; immediately following it.
; This can be converted into an address/length pair with COUNT.
; Returns:
;  False if successful
;  True if not successful
; This allows trapping with ABORT" as follows:
; MYFILE #GET ABORT" Could not read from the file"
; If the read fails, IOERR is set to the error code, otherwise it is zero'd
