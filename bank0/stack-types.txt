11.7 Stack Parameters  

          Unless otherwise stated, all references to numbers apply to 16-
          bit signed integers.  The implied range of values is shown as
          {from..to}.  The contents of an address is shown by double
          braces, particularly for the contents of variables, i.e., BASE
          {{2..72}}.

          The following are the stack parameter abbreviations and types of
          numbers used throughout the glossary.  These abbreviations may be
          suffixed with a digit to differentiate multiple parameters of the
          same type.

                    dependent stack entries  not applicable      na

          Any other symbol refers to an arbitrary signed 16-bit integer in
          the range {-32,768..32,767}, unless otherwise noted.

          Because of the use of two's complement arithmetic, the signed 16-
          bit number (n) -1 has the same bit representation as the unsigned
          number (u) 65,535.  Both of these numbers are within the set of
          unspecified weighted numbers (w).
